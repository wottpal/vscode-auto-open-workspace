# auto-open-workspace README

VSCode Extension that checks the active directory for `*.code-workspace` files and offers to open one of those. 

It can also be actively invoked via the `auto-open-workspace.open-workspace-file` command.

Read more about VSCode Workspaces and how they work [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces).

I will release the extension to the VSCode Marketplace soon, until then download the [latest release](https://github.com/wottpal/vscode-auto-open-workspace/releases) and execute:
